This theme is written for Cloudlog V2. It is currently being developed, and can be found here: https://github.com/magicbug/Cloudlog/tree/station_logbooks

What's different from the regular themes in Cloudlog?
* It's wider
* The popup dialog is wider
* The scrollbar is themed
* The height of the dashboard map, gridsquare map and logbook map is higher

To use this, follow these steps:
* Upload the folder of the theme (with files) into <Cloudlog-directory>\assets\css.
* Go to Admin - Themes. Add a theme. In the name, you can call it whatever you want. The folder name must be the name of the folder you uploaded.
* Edit your user account and select the theme you added.

If you find any issues, open an issue here, and I'll look into it.
